  <h1>Delaware is the fastest-growing state in the Mid-Atlantic. Why aren't Delaware's counties and municipalities building housing to match that growth?</h1>
</div>

<h2>What happens when we don't build enough housing?</h2>

<p>As Delaware's population booms -- driven in no small part by an influx of retirees -- local governments have been unwilling to <strong><em>fast-track multifamily housing developments in urban cores</em></strong> and <strong><em>reform local zoning ordinances</em></strong> to accommodate new arrivals and long-time residents.</p>

<p>The vast majority of housing permitted in Delaware since the late 20th century has been single-family: the least space-efficient form of housing, made even less efficient by minimum lot size requirements in county and municipal zoning codes. </p>

<p>The result? A <a href="https://www.delawarepublic.org/show/the-green/2023-0a2-17/housing-advocates-anticipate-an-undercount-in-latest-survey-of-homelessness-in-delaware" target="_blank">mounting homelessness crisis</a> and increasing reliance on overcrowded, substandard housing -- often manufactured housing or remnants of a bygone era of high-density housing construction. </p>

<p>The Delaware State Housing Authority and community partners, including Housing Alliance Delaware, advocate for supply-side solutions to the state's housing crisis, but local-level advocacy is scarce. </p>

<p>Rental vacancy rates are a basic indicator of rental housing availability. Delaware has among the lowest rental vacancy rates in the United States as of 2022, surpassed only by several New England states. With rental options scarce, the state's rental assistance program has been forced to abandon long-subsidized units in high-demand areas like Rehoboth in favor of units in more distant rural communities from which low-income workers commute. The subsidy for a single unit in Rehoboth could cover two units in Laurel, for instance. </p>

<p> As a consequence, many essential workers in Delaware are severely burdened by housing costs, limiting their ability to support the state's economic growth by spending money on goods and services.</p>

<h2> What can a state government do to address a housing shortage?</h2>

<ol>
  <li>States like <a href="https://www.planning.org/planning/2023/fall/how-the-bipartisan-montana-miracle-confronts-the-housing-crisis-head-on/" target="_blank"> Montana have enacted state-level zoning reform to expand opportunities to build multifamily housing.</a></li>
  <li>States like <a href="https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2023/9/15/ending-minimum-parking-requirements-was-a-policy-win-for-the-twin-cities" target="_blank"> Minnesota have prohibited municipalities from enforcing parking minimums for new developments</a>, which reduces the up-front cost of building multifamily housing.</li>
  <li>States like <a href="https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2021/9/29/the-secret-sauce-maybe-of-californias-zoning-reform" target="_blank"> California have implemented so-called "housing element" legislation </a> that requires municipalities to approve a minimum number of new housing units or lose local zoning control.</li>
</ol>



<h2> But Delaware prides itself on its small-town character - wouldn't building more housing threaten its charm? </h2>

<p> Perhaps more than most states, Delaware has a strong reverence for the small town as an institution. The General Assembly rarely <a href="https://www.delawarepublic.org/politics-government/2023-06-30/house-republicans-walk-out-block-bond-bill-over-seaford-charter-amendment" target="_blank"> overrules the decisions of town or county councils </a>, and state lawmakers generally express reluctance to introduce legislation that would override local zoning authority.</p>

<p> That means the center of attention for those interested in a more affordable and sustainable Delaware should be town councils, city couuncils and county councils.</p>
<p> One possible line of argument involves preservation of valuable argicultural land. Delaware's Department of Agriculture has placed relatively few parcels of agricultural land into preservation programs, and as the number of active farms decline, vast tracts of productive agricultural land have been cleared to build single-family subdivisions - often miles from the nearest grocery store. While the loss of this fertile farmland may not seem dire now, the challenges to American agriculture posed by climate change mean that preserving farmland in as many regions of the country as possible is crucial for the nation's food security.</p>

<p> The subdivisions themselves also come with obvious downsides that might resonate with a small town council. Extending services - particularly emergency response - to far-flung, low-density subdivisions is expensive, and the state's relatively low property taxes mean that counties and municipalities generally do not recover the cost of serving sprawling suburban communities. The subdivisions also generally lack sidewalks and other key amenities necessary for community-building, making them impractical substitutes for the traditionally dense small town neighborhoods that are no longer legal to build practically anywhere in Delaware. In other words, fiscal responsibility and traditionalism favor denser development.</p>

<h2> Delaware has a long way to go, but that is no reason to give up. </h2>

<p> If you are the type of person who cares deeply about healthy urban or small town environments - or simply someone who wants an affordable home - you may be considering leaving Delaware (or simply moving to Wilmington, which is a model for the rest of the state).</p>
<p> That is a reasonable response to a housing crisis, but remember: <strong><em> the problem will not be solved until enough people advocate for a solution.</em></strong></p>

<h2> Addressing Delaware's housing shortage is critical for the state's economic survival, health, and identity development. Attend a town council meeting, seek out a zoning board member, and support dense housing.</h2>
