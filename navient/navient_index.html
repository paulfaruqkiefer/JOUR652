      <h2>As Navient Reaches Settlements, Complaints Slow to a Trickle</h2>
      <br>
      <p><em><strong>Paul Kiefer</strong></em></p>
      <br>

      <p>After a wave of complaints from borrowers in 2017, <a href="https://www.studentloanplanner.com/navient-lawsuit-updates/" target="_blank"> the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau filed a lawsuit against the federal student loan servicer Navient Corporation accusing the company of failing to act in its customers' best interest.</a></p>

      <p>The lawsuit alleged that <a href="https://navient.com/Navient" target="_blank"> Navient</a> had, among other failures, provided inaccurate loan reports to credit bureaus and "failed to correctly apply" borrowers' student loan payments to their accounts.</p>

      <p>The CFPB's lawsuit was the first in a series of legal actions filed against Navient; by July 2018, attorneys general from a half-dozen states had filed their own lawsuits against Navient, as did a group of teachers backed by the country's second-largest teachers' union, the American Federation of Teachers. In their lawsuit, the group of teachers accused Navient of preventing eligible borrowers from taking advantage of the federal Public Service Loan Forgiveness program.</p>

      <p>The surge in complaints that initially triggered the CFPB's lawsuit quickly subsided as the case made its way through the courts. While the number of complaints has not yet stabilized at pre-2017 levels, the CFPB has seen no comparable spike in complaints in the last seven years.</p>

      <p>Borrowers from the Northeast and South were overrepresented among those who <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/consumer-complaints/search/?chartType=line&dateInterval=Month&dateRange=All&date_received_max=2024-04-10&date_received_min=2011-12-01&lens=Product&searchField=all&searchText=Navient&subLens=sub_product&tab=Trendssubmitted" target="_blank"> complaints to the CFPB.</a> The Northeast produced roughly twice as many complaints per capita as the Western US, for example.</p>

      </script>

      <p>The majority of complaints centered on Navient's federal student loan servicing practices, and those complaints have declined dramatically since 2017. Complaints about private student loans also peaked in 2017, albeit with substentially fewer total complaints.</p>

      </script>

      <br><br>

      <p>The Northeast also produced a disproprortionate number of complaints about Navient's servicing of private student loans. In August 2017, the Northeast produced more than twice as many complaints per capita as the South. The two regions produced roughly the same number of complaints about Navient's servicing of federal student loans per capita; the complaints about private student loans account for the difference between the two regions.</p>

      <p>While the number of complaints about Navient's servicing of private student loans has also declined since 2017, that decline has not been as dramatic as the decline in complaints about Navient's servicing of federal student loans.</p>

      <p>In January 2022, Navient announced a settlement with 39 state attorneys general that requires the company to cancel $1.7 billion in subprime student loan balances for more than 66,000 borrowers and pay $95 million in restitution to roughly 350,000 federal student loan borrowers. The settlement also requires Navient to update its services and train specialists to advise struggling borrowers on income-based repayment plans or forgiveness programs.</p>

      <p>Six months later, Navient reached a separate settlement with the group of teachers requiring the company to improve training on the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program and donate $1.75 million to a student loan counseling nonprofit; borrowers who were misled by Navient will not receive compensation from the settlement.</p>

      <p>The initial CFPB lawsuit is still ongoing.</p>
