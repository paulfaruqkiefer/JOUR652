            <p> Wilmington, Delaware was - and remains - a city with great potential. Where it has been preserved, the city's late-19th century urban fabric is comparable to the better-preserved parts of Philadelphia or Baltimore. Its northern and western suburbs are raised high enough above the Delaware River to mitigate flood risk, making them ideal candidates for densification. It is served by Philadelphia's SEPTA system and Amtrak's Acela service, and it could easily fall within the reach of an expanded MARC commuter rail system. Like all too many American cities, however, the damage of mid-20th century urban renewal has left Wilmington with many holes to patch.</p>

            <p> The most visible scar on the city cuts a canyon between the city's Hilltop neighborhood and the western edge of downtown. The construction of I-95 through Wilmington between 1957 and 1967 required the destruction of a relatively stable middle-class neighborhood and the displacement of hundreds of families. It also provided a six-lane artery to funnel high-wage workers - and their tax dollars - out of the city and into the ever-growing sprawl of suburban subdivisions that continue to consume the state's productive farmland, stripping away the city's tax base. </p>

            <p> The assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in April 1968 sparked rioting in downtown Wilmington, prompting Delaware's governor to deploy the national guard to the city. Delaware National Guard troops occupied the city until January 1969, accelerating the exodus of middle- and upper-class families from the city. At roughly the same time, a planning organization formed and led by executive leadership from the DuPont Chemical company -- the state's most dominant private-sector employer -- successfully lobbied Wilmington's city council to demolish a 10-block stretch of homes and businesses on the east side of downtown Wilmington for the construction of a civic center and mall. Demolition did not begin until the early 1970s, but while most of the civic center project would never be realized, a core commercial district for the city's majority-Black east side was reduced to barren parking lots and state office buildings. The already impoverished east side of Wilmington has not yet recovered from the loss of its core retail district.</p>

            <p> Both west and east of I-95, the city is a shell of its former self, with relatively infrequent public transit service, high rates of pedestrian fatalities on roadways, and roughly 1,400 vacant homes scattered across the city. Suburbanization and school integration in the mid-1960s - despite its proximity to Philadelphia, Delaware was a Jim Crow state in some respects - also left Wilmington without a high school of its own, meaning that all Wilmington high school age students must be bussed out of the city to continue their education.</p>

            <p> Wilmington residents are acutely aware of the lasting damage done to the city by the planning decisions of the mid-20th century. The city's most famous resident, President Joe Biden, was an early opponent of highway expansion in the city during his tenure on the New Castle County Council. In an attempt to remedy some of that damage, the Delaware Department of Transportation and the Wilmington city planning office have unveiled plans to build a cap over I-95 in the city's downtown core, theoretically providing a community space to connect neighborhoods severed by construction in the 1950s and 1960s. The cap would not, however, be suitable for residential construction. </p>
